# Numerique_PY
Python codes written to solve and experiment with simple numerical methods and PDEs. 


I will keep updating this from time to time as I develop more content.

## 2d Linear Convection

1) The first code added solves the Linear Convection in two dimension. This codes provides a good visualization as to how numerical dissipation affects the solution depending on CFL number.
